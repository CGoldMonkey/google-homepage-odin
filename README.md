Current Project: Build the Google.com (http://www.google.com/) homepage.  Recreate it.  
Skill's Demonstrated: Positioning of elements.  Links.  Form function for search bar.  Ended up using CSS Grid for the Header and Footer elements.  Made the Header and footer navigational bars (horizontal navigation) using <ul><li> and getting rid of the list style and making them inline.  Spacing of content on the page using margins and padding. 

For the main content of the page I set up a Search bar with buttons using <form> element and its <input> elements.  Used CSS to style the search bar and buttons so that the edges were rounded out, spacing, and added padding.  Added a icon to the search bar (magnifyin glass) by using <span> and relative positioning. Originally centered it using text align center and having the child div inside set to display: inline-block.  Found it easier to just use CSS Flexbox to center the whole thing horizontally and vertically.

Skills Demonstrated include: 
CSS Grid to make Headers and Footers
Form elements for Searchbar
CSS Flexbox for main page content
Navigation bar by using <ul><li> and modifying with CSS
Postitioning using Padding, Margins, position: fixed (footer), position: relative (icon)
General CSS Styling: color, background-color, margin, font-family, etc.

Things to keep in mind:
May be a better way to put the icon in the search bar.
Dropdown menu when clicking on Google apps.  Ignored that.  May be interesting to get it up some time.  Probably involve some variation of onClick.
